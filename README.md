# boca_and_buttons
Interactive installation using 30 buttons, sound, and motors

First Arduino (buttons.ino) detects button presses for thirty buttons. 
If a button is pressed, a sound file is played and a signal is sent to 
the other Arduino (boca.ino), which moves motors controlling a giant mouth.

Uses Arduinos (with RX/TX), DFPlayer Mini, stepper motors, and limit switches.

Created with Jack the Maker for Heineken
